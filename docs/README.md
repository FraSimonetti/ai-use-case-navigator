# Documentation

This folder contains all project documentation except the root `README.md`.

## Structure

- `guides/`

  - `deployment.md`: Deployment options and production setup.
- `archive/`
  - Historical implementation notes, audits, and change logs.
- `prompts/`

## Notes

- Historical files in `archive/` are kept for traceability but are not required for runtime.
- For setup and day-to-day usage, start from the root `README.md`.
