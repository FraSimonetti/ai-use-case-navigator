# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security updates are provided for the latest `main` branch.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, do not open a public issue.

Preferred path:
1. Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting ("Report a vulnerability" in the Security tab) when available.

Fallback path:
1. Contact project maintainers privately through GitHub.
2. Include reproduction steps, impact, and any proof-of-concept details.
3. Share your preferred contact for follow-up questions.

## Response Process

Maintainers will:
1. Acknowledge receipt as quickly as possible.
2. Triage severity and impact.
3. Work on a fix and coordinate disclosure timing.
4. Credit reporters when appropriate.
